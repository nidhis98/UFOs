# UFOs

1. Overview of Project

	The purpose of this analysis was to assist Dana in creating an interactive webpage based on UFO Sightings. Using JavaScript, we were able to upload a multitude of UFO sightings based on time, location, and other signifying criteria. Users will be able to visit the webpage and filter the table created to locate a specific UFO sighting and its key details.

3. Summary

       Although this new design can store and filter through a mass amount of information, a drawback to this design could be doing research for multiple different locations or time ranges. The filter table is beneficial in this regard, however, locating info for numerous UFO sightings with differing data types can be time consuming. A slight modification Dana can make to offset this is to allow the table to add several filter items to an existing search. This adjustment to the filter table would make it similar to tables built in Excel, which make it easier to compare different data types. Another easy to implement recommendation I would provide to Dana to add to the appeal of the page, would be to add an image gallery behind the jumbotron.

Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
