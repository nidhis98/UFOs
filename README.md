# UFOs

1. Overview of Project

			The purpose of this analysis was to assist Dana in creating an interactive webpage based on UFO Sightings. Using JavaScript, we were able to upload a multitude of UFO sightings based on time, location, and other signifying criteria. Users will be able to visit the webpage and filter the table created to locate a specific UFO sighting and its key details.

2. Results

			As shown below, the filter table has five options to choose from to narrow down a user’s search results. Depending on which UFO sighting(s) the user is searching for, one or more of the five filters can be applied (Figure 1).

      	As displayed in Figure 2 below, the filter table is being used to search for a UFO sighting using one of the five filters. In this demonstration, the city filter is used to search for UFO sightings which occurred in Fresno. The results on the righthand side show that there has been one UFO sighting in Fresno, as of 01/01/2010.

       	Additionally, multiple filters can be used to search for a UFO sighting. In Figure 3, we’ve applied the date and shape filter to narrow down the search results to UFO sightings which were light-based and occurred on 01/01/2010. To reduce the number of results which appear, it would be advised to a new user to apply as many of the filters as possible to get a more precise search result.

3. Summary

      	Although this new design is straightforward enough for new users to follow, a drawback that I notice is that it currently only holds a limited selection of data. To gain and maintain traction to the webpage, the dataset would need to be periodically updated with any new sightings. Additional recommendations I would provide to Dana would be to add to the appeal of the page. This includes to regularly replace the image used behind the jumbotron, or to upgrade the current imagery by substituting it with an image gallery. The webpage also has enough to scope to include another illustration or chart. My recommendation would be to add a table of facts alongside the opening text we have for UFOs. Contrarily, a graph, such as a pie chart, can be added to show the data collected from each city/state as the user filters the table. Either additions to the page would make the page more interactive for users and add further content on UFO sightings.
